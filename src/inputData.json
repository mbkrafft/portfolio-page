    "aboutme": "While writing my engineering thesis about feeding pellets to fish in underwater cages through tubes,  we needed to do complex calculations and simulate the transport of the pellets. This was done through writing code in MATLAB and Python. I was hooked. Since then, I've studied informatics to improve my skills and further cultivate my passion for coding.  The journey that initially started with data visualization and differential equations has led me to machine learning and natural language processing.  I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in language technology, where we study how computers, using machine learning techniques, can make sense of human language and how humans communicate through language.",
